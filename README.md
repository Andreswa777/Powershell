# Powershell

Repo of some of the powershell scripts i've needed to compile for work

List of scripts and their functions:<br />
MDO_AllowBlock_Senderdomain.ps1 - This script allows the user to add multiple addresses (withing the inputBox) and appends it to the Anti-Spam policy to either allow or block sender or domain<br />
AppRegistration_MailboxRestriction.ps1 - This script will control the access surface of an app registration that focuses on reading mailboxes. This allows you to specify which mailboxes the app can read. <br />
